## Description

This is a book search API that allows users to search for books and save them to their profile. This application uses the Google Books API to search for books and MongoDB to save the books to the user's profile. This application was built using the MERN stack.

## Installation

To install this application, clone the code into your terminal for the respective repository. Then, install npm by entering the command `npm i` into the terminal. Then, run the application by entering the command `npm start` into the terminal. You can also run `npm run develop` to run the application using nodemon to automatically restart the server when changes are made to the code. The application will then be running on your local server.

## Usage

Upon opening the application, you will encounter a search bar where you can enter the title of the book you wish to find. Click the search button to initiate the search, and the application will display the search results as a list of books. From this list, you can save a book to your profile by clicking the "Save" button. To access your saved books, simply click the "See Your Books" button in the navigation bar. From there, you can view each saved book and choose to either view it on the Google Books website by clicking "View," or delete it from your profile by clicking "Delete." To save and delete a book from your profile, you will need to log in or create a profile within the application. Once you have done so, you can follow the steps outlined in my previous response to save and delete books to and from your profile.
